An android launcher that responds to your touch.

# About the Project

Many times it happens that we keep a phone unlocked which other people can access which is unsafe or you just don't want to have a lock on your phone. Whatever the situation is, Swift have you covered. This app uses finger sensor on your device to authenticate and then show the application drawer. Now you don't have to lock your phone every time. The applications can only be accessed with your fingerprint which means only you or the registered fingerprint holders can access your phone.

# FAQ

### How to install the app?
    
Find the installation link in the 'Installation' section of this readme. Tap on the link for direct installation in your android device or downloadable apk from desktop or laptop.

### Why is it asking for storage permission?

Storage permission is required to load the wallpaper for the app. The access to storage permission is not used for any other purpose and is completely safe to allow it.

### I declined the storage permission at startup and now the app is behaving unusually. What should I do?

Go to the Settings of your device and find the application from the list of installed applications and grant the storage permission. Hopefully this will remove any issue.

### I don't have fingerprint sensor on my phone or no fingerprint is registered. Can I use Swift?

Yes, definitely you can. There is a secret access path to get your application drawer without using the fingerprint sensor. Try to find it. In case you give up, mail me at the provided email address. But try to find it yourself, it is right in front of your eyes.

### I Have installed the app. What to do next?

When using Swift, It should automatically prompt for fingerprint authentication. If it isn't doing so, press the back button to bring up the prompt or find the hidden way to access to application drawer. Have fun.
